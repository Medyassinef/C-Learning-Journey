# C Programming Projects

Welcome to my C programming journey! This repository contains a collection of projects and exercises that Iâ€™ve completed while learning C. Each project covers different topics, from basic syntax to more complex algorithms.

## Repository Structure

- **/basics/**: Fundamental programs (e.g., loops, functions, arrays).
- **/intermediate/**: Projects that involve file handling, pointers, memory management, etc.
- **/advanced/**: More complex programs (e.g., data structures, algorithms).
- **/notes/**: Personal notes and references about C programming concepts.

## Getting Started

To run any project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Medyassinef/C-Learning-Journey.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd C-Learning-Journey
3. Compile the C files using GCC:
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o outputname
5. Run the compiled file:
   ```bash
   ./outputname
